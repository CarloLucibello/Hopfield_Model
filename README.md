# Hopfield Model

In this repository we provide numerical simulations to investigate the basins of attractions of the Hopfield Model.
## Standard Hopfield

### Critical Noise
An important question related to the basins of attractions of this model is the following: if we perturb a stored pattern with a given noise (i.e. we flip each spin with probability $p$) , what is the probability to recover the original pattern? For $N$ and $\alpha$ given this probability is a sigmoid-like function. If we let $N\to \infty$ we get a step function and the related threshold is the `Critical Noise`.

### Matrix Factorization
Another interesting problem related to the `Standard Hopfield` model is the one of `Matrix Factorization`. Here we are provided with the coupling matrix $J$ generated by some unknown patterns ${\xi}$. The goal is to infer the stored patterns.
