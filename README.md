# Hopfield Model
In this repository we provide numerical simulations to investigate the basins of attractions of the Hopfield Model.
## Standard Hopfield
In the `Standard Hopfield` model, patterns $\bm{\xi} \in [-1, 1]^N$ are stored exploiting the Hebb's rule, where we define a coupling matrix $J$ with entries given by:
$$
	J_{ij} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\mu = 1}^M \xi_i^\mu\xi_j^\mu,
$$
where $M = \alpha N$ is the number of stored patterns.
The energy of a configuration $\bm{\sigma}$ is:
$$
E(\bm{\sigma}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j.
$$
This model is able to store at most $M = \alpha_c N$ patterns with $\alpha_c \simeq 0.138$.
### Critical Noise
An important question related to the basins of attractions of this model is the following: if we perturb a stored pattern with a given noise (i.e. we flip each spin with probability $p$) , what is the probability to recover the original pattern? For $N$ and $\alpha$ given this probability is a sigmoid-like function. If we let $N\to \infty$ we get a step function and the related threshold is the `Critical Noise`.

### Matrix Factorization
Another interesting problem related to the `Standard Hopfield` model is the one of `Matrix Factorization`. Here we are provided with the coupling matrix $J$ generated by some unknown patterns $\bm{\xi}$. The goal is to infer the stored patterns.
