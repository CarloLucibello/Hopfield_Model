# Hopfield Model

In this repository we provide numerical simulations to investigate the basins of attractions of the Hopfield Model.

## Quick Start
In the Hopfield Model we're able to store M binary (and also continuous in the Modern version) patterns, i.e. a configuration of neurons $\xi = [-1,1]^N$, where N is the size of the system.
The storage process consists in assigning a low energy to the patterns that we want to store.

### Monte Carlo algorithm
The energy minimization is performed exploiting the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm.
In particular, given a configuration $\sigma$:

- select a random spin;
- if the energy variation related to the flip is $< 0$ we accept the flip; otherwise we accept the flip only with probability given by $exp(-\beta \Delta E )$, where $\Delta E$ is the change in energy and $\beta$ is the inverse of the temperature;
- repeat N times.

## Critical noise
One important question related to the basins of attractions of the Hopfield Model is: how much can we perturb a pattern in order to be able to reconstruct it?
For details see `Standard_Hopfield/Critical Noise` and `Modern Hopfield/Critical Noise`.

## Matrix factorization
If we are provided with a coupling matrix $J$, generated by M unknown patterns, is it possible to find those patterns? This is addressed to as a matrix factorization problem since one has $J = \xi \xi^T$.
For details see `Standard Hopfield/Matrix Factorization`.
